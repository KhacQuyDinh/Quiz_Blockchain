Based on this, here's some advice on reducing gas cost:

Only write to storage when you are finished with your computations, use local variables to remember your progress (if applicable)

Avoid too much writing to and reading from storage

Avoid creating too many new contracts

Avoid reading too much global state (for example getting the balance of an address)

Avoid too many transactions

Use bytes32 instead of string for small strings

Avoid loops that run too many times, especially if they contain expensive instructions
