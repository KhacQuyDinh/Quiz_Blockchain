pragma solidity ^0.4.17 asserts the version of Solidity compiler that is expected.

The view declaration is surprisingly important in Solidity contracts because view functions can be executed for free. But cannot change the value.

smart contract function execution requires payment (in Ether), which is called “gas”.

+ Ethereum smart contracts represent persistent code and data on the Ethereum blockchain.

+ Once deployed, a contract exists forever, and any public can be invoked by anybody.

+ functions without view cost gas(ether) to be executed.

+ if a func fails to terminate normally, it will have no persistent side effect.
